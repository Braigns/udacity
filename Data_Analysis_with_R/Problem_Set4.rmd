### 1. Price vs. x

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)

# Your first task is to create a
# scatterplot of price vs x.
# using the ggplot syntax.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x, y=price)) + geom_point()
```



### 3. Correlations

```{r}
# correlation between price and x
with(diamonds, cor.test(x, price))

# correlation between price and y
with(diamonds, cor.test(y, price))

# correlation between price and z
with(diamonds, cor.test(z, price))
```



### 4. Price vs. Depth

```{r}
# Create a simple scatter plot of price vs depth.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=depth, y=price)) + geom_point()
```



### 5. Adjustments -- Price vs. Depth

```{r}
# Change the code to make the transparency of the
# points to be 1/100 of what they are now and mark
# the x-axis every 2 units. 
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(42,80,2))
```



### 7. Correlation -- Price and Depth

```{r}
cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$depth)
```



### 8. Price vs. Carat

```{r}
# Create a scatterplot of price vs carat
# and omit the top 1% of price and carat
# values.
price99 <- quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99)
carat99 <- quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99)
ggplot(subset(diamonds, price < price99 & carat < carat99), aes(x=carat, y=price)) +
  geom_point()
```



### 9. Price vs. Volume

```{r}
# Create a scatterplot of price vs. volume (x * y * z).
# This is a very rough approximation for a diamond's volume.

# Create a new variable for volume in the diamonds data frame.
# This will be useful in a later exercise.
diamonds$volume <- diamonds$x * diamonds$y * diamonds$z
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=volume, y=price)) + geom_point()
```



### 10. Correlations on Subsets

```{r}
# What's the correlation of price and volume?
# Exclude diamonds that have a volume of zero or
# that are >= 800.  
with(subset(diamonds, 0 < volume & volume < 800), cor.test(price, volume))
```



### 11. Adjustments -- Price vs. Volume

```{r}
# Subset the data to exclude diamonds with a volume
# greater than or equal to 800. Also, exclude diamonds
# with a volume of 0. Adjust the transparency of the
# points and add a linear model to the plot.
ggplot(subset(diamonds, 0 < volume & volume < 800), aes(x=volume, y=price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.05) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', color='red')
```



### 12. Mean Price by Clarity

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Use the function dplyr package
# to create a new data frame containing
# info on diamonds by clarity.

# Name the data frame diamondsByClarity

# The data frame should contain the following
# variables in this order.

#       (1) mean_price
#       (2) median_price
#       (3) min_price
#       (4) max_price
#       (5) n

# where n is the number of diamonds in each
# level of clarity.

diamondsByClarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity) %>%
  summarise( mean_price=mean(price),
             median_price=median(price),
             min_price=min(price),
             max_price=max(price),
             n=n())
```



### 13. Bar Charts of Mean Price

```{r}
diamonds_by_clarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity)
diamonds_mp_by_clarity <- summarise(diamonds_by_clarity, mean_price = mean(price))

diamonds_by_color <- group_by(diamonds, color)
diamonds_mp_by_color <- summarise(diamonds_by_color, mean_price = mean(price))
# We've created summary data frames with the mean price
# by clarity and color. You can run the code in R to
# verify what data is in the variables diamonds_mp_by_clarity
# and diamonds_mp_by_color.

# Your task is to write additional code to create two bar plots
# on one output image using the grid.arrange() function from the package
# gridExtra.

library(gridExtra)
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds_mp_by_clarity, aes(x=clarity, y=mean_price)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds_mp_by_color, aes(x=color, y=mean_price)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=1)
```



### 14. Gapminder Revisited

```{r}
# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
# end of Problem Set 3 or you can start fresh and choose a different
# data set from Gapminder.

# If you're feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can
# find a data set or scrape one from the web.

# In your investigation, examine pairs of variable and create 2-5 plots that make
# use of the techniques from Lesson 4.
